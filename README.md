# Multiclass Image Classification using Transfer Learning

## Overview

Image classification stands as one of the tasks in supervised machine learning, with the primary goal of assigning images from a dataset into their respective categories or labels. A classic example of this is the classification of images representing various dog breeds. Since this task involves classifying into more than one category, it's referred to as multi-class classification. In this article, we'll tackle this challenge by leveraging a pre-trained model known as InceptionResNetV2 and customizing it to our needs.

## Key Concepts

### Transfer Learning

Transfer learning is a well-established technique in deep learning, where we harness knowledge gained from one task and apply it to solve another related task. Instead of constructing a neural network from scratch, we "transfer" the learned features, essentially the "weights" of the network. In our case, this involves using "pre-trained models."

### Essentials of Transfer Learning

To make transfer learning effective, it's crucial that the low-level features learned by model A (in task A) are beneficial for training model B (in task B).

### Pre-trained Models

Pre-trained models are deep learning models that have undergone extensive training on vast datasets. They're typically developed and shared by other contributors in the machine learning community to tackle similar problems. These models encapsulate the biases and weights of the neural network, which represent the features learned from the dataset they were initially trained on. These learned features are versatile and transferable. For instance, a model trained on a sizable dataset of flower images might have learned features like edges, corners, shapes, colors, etc.

### InceptionResNetV2

InceptionResNetV2 is a convolutional neural network that boasts a depth of 164 layers. It has been trained on a vast collection of images sourced from the ImageNet database and is capable of categorizing images into over 1000 distinct categories, spanning subjects such as flowers, animals, and more. The input size for images to be processed by this network is set at 299-by-299 pixels.
